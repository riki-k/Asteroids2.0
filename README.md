# Asteroids 2.0

Asteroids 2.0 is a revisitation of asteroids, created using Unity.

The gameplay takes most of the features of the original game while modifying others.
The player starts with 3 lives, will have to face asteroids wandering through space and occasional UFOs shooting in the player's direction.
